            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed
                in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting
                languages
                such as JavaScript. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Hyper Text:</strong> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a
                hypertext.
                Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext.
                HyperText
                is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Markup language:</strong> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout
                and
                formatting
                conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn
                text
                into images, tables, links, etc.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Web Page:</strong> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by
                a
                web browser.
                A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With
                the
                help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written
                in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside
                HTML and JavaScript. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>What is CSS for?:</strong> As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how
                documents are
                presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
                <br><br>
                <strong>CSS Syntax:</strong> CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of
                styles that
                should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
                <br><br>
                <strong>CSS Modules:</strong> As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language
                is
                broken down
                into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages
                are
                organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the
                Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and features it
                contains.
                In that module, you will also find a link to Specifications that defines the technology (also see the
                section below).

            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
                the
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
                for
                webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>High-Level Defination:</strong> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you
                to
                implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and
                display
                static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated
                2D/3D
                graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the
                third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered
                in
                much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
                <br><br>
                <strong>What is JavaScript doing on your page?:</strong> Here we'll actually start looking at some code,
                and
                while doing so, explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Browser Security:</strong> Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in
                (these
                buckets are called "execution environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code
                in
                each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in
                another
                tab — or on another website. This is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates
                could
                start writing code to steal information from other websites, and other such bad things.
